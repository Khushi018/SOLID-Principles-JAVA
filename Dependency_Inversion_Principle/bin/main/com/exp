Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.

- Use abstractions to decouple dependencies 
+ between parts of the system.

- Avoid direct calls between code units
+ use interfaces or abstractions.
Abstraction over Concretion

By depending on abstractions, modules become more flexible and interchangeable,
 allowing easier substitution of implementations without requiring changes in higher-level modules.
